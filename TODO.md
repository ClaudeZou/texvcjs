# Future Tasks

* Parse \limits and \nolimits more precisely -- there is a small set of
  functions they are valid after.
* Verify UTF-8 handling
  - does CLI handle utf-8 correctly?
  - can we safely include utf-8 inside an \mbox?
* Add test cases from [[mw:MathTest]]
* Add test cases from en-wiki-formulae.tar.gz; see
